# zombocom-fix
This is a Chrome extension that improves the zombo.com experience. I made this extension because zombo.com was rewritten in HTML5 after Flash was discontinued, but the new version has issues and is missing features. Why did I do this? *Because you can do anything at zombocom. Anything at all. The only limit is yourself.*

## Installation
Navigate to `chrome://extensions`, enable **"Developer mode"** in the upper right corner, click **"Load unpacked,"** and select the directory `zombocom-fix-extension`.

## Features
- **Removes scrollbar** to stop the screen from shaking
- **Hides volume button once clicked** to preserve the pure zombo.com aesthetics
  - I wanted to remove the volume button entirely, but Chrome now requires a user interation before playing audio
- And most importantly, **Re-implements the NewZLetter link**
  - Accurately timed from zombo.com on Internet Archive using Ruffle
  - Includes the fancy typewriter effect
